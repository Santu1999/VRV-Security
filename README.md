# VRV-Security

### **Core Requirements**

- Implement an authentication system where users can register, log in, and log out securely.
- Implement authorization based on roles (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator). Ensure that each role has specific permissions to access certain resources or endpoints.
- Use secure methods such as JWT or OAuth for managing sessions and user authentication.
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, where the access to resources is determined based on the user's assigned role.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Security Best Practices**
    - Correct implementation of secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., password hashing, JWT, OAuth).
    - Proper implementation of authorization (ensuring that users only access resources they are authorized to).
2. **Role-Based Access Control**
    - Effectiveness and flexibility of your RBAC system in managing user roles and permissions.
    - How well the RBAC is integrated into the overall system (e.g., making sure only authorized roles can access certain routes or perform specific actions).
3. **Code Quality and Organization**
    - Clarity, readability, and modularity of the code.
    - Proper use of comments and documentation where necessary
4. **Creativity and Implementation**
    - Your ability to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the concepts, through a creative and practical solution.
    - Whether you included additional features that enhance security or improve user management.
